                        Context: Maybe the anonymous credentials approach from [2] could use credentials loaded with sats?


                        ### Output: [/INST] In a recent email, the sender mentioned the possibility of using anonymous credentials loaded with sats as part of the anonymous credentials approach discussed in reference [2]. The idea is to leverage the use of sats (short for satoshis) within the context of anonymous credentials. While the email does not provide further details or explanations, it raises an interesting concept that could potentially enhance the functionality and security of anonymous credentials.Anonymous credentials are a cryptographic tool used to prove certain statements about oneself without revealing any additional information. They enable individuals to authenticate themselves or assert specific attributes without compromising their privacy. The approach proposed in reference [2] explores the use of anonymous credentials in a broader context, possibly in relation to blockchain technology and decentralized systems.By introducing the notion of loading credentials with sats, the email suggests incorporating the use of Bitcoin's smallest unit, satoshis, into the anonymous credentials framework. This integration could offer several advantages, such as increased flexibility and efficiency in transactional processes. However, without further details provided in the email, it is difficult to fully grasp the implications and potential benefits of this approach.It is worth noting that referencing external sources, like reference [2], indicates that there is existing research or documentation on the topic. In this case, it would be beneficial to explore the contents of reference [2] to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the anonymous credentials approach and its potential integration with sats. Unfortunately, the email does not provide any direct links or additional information regarding reference [2].In conclusion, the email briefly touches upon the idea of using anonymous credentials loaded with sats, potentially as part of the approach discussed in reference [2]. While the concept is intriguing, the lack of detailed information limits our understanding of the exact implications and benefits. Further exploration of reference [2] and related literature might shed more light on this topic."

                        Context: Good morning Mr Nuclear, The major difference here is that for PoW, it is impossible to create a ""sybil attack"" where you only need to spin up multiple nodes on AWS containers, each with its own identity. For PoW, every such node requires its own continuous hashpower; on Lightning, each such node can be generated by simply incrementing a 256-bit number. Thus, the honest majority assumption can **only** be relied on if you have ***some*** sybil-resistance. PoW *is* the sybil-resistance that Bitcoin uses. In short: you can only reason ""I think, therefore I am"", but you cannot from there derive that others exist; you MUST assume that there are only two entities: yourself, and the rest of the universe. Without any sybil-resistance mechanism, it is entirely possible for me to run multiple nodes, then vote you out of your funds. There is a reason why every non-custodial trust-minimized multiparticipant offchain mechanism requires n-of-n. Regards, ZmnSCPxj


                        ### Output: [/INST] The email discusses the major difference between Proof of Work (PoW) and Lightning Network in terms of sybil attacks. It explains that for PoW, it is impossible to create a sybil attack by spinning up multiple nodes on AWS containers with their own identity. This is because every node in PoW requires its own continuous hashpower. On the other hand, in Lightning Network, each node can be generated by simply incrementing a 256-bit number.The email emphasizes that the honest majority assumption can only be relied upon if there is some form of sybil-resistance. PoW itself acts as the sybil-resistance mechanism used in Bitcoin. Without any sybil-resistance mechanism, it is entirely possible for someone to run multiple nodes and vote others out of their funds.The author concludes by stating that there is a reason why every non-custodial trust-minimized multiparticipant offchain mechanism requires n-of-n, highlighting the importance of having a sybil-resistance mechanism in place.(Note: The farewell part of the email has been ignored as per the given rules.)"

                        Context: Dear Mr Nucleus, and list, Some more points: * Miners in existing Bitcoin are only given the ability to reorder transactions, but not to outright spend funds. This is why drivechains --- and recursive covenants, which, with some additional covenant features (that are more useful in general for covenants), could potentially enable a drivechain-like facility --- are contentious. Drivechains escrow some set of funds to the miners, allowing the miners to vote to outright spend those funds as they please. Now you might say, that if a 51% miner already exists, it can easily censor any transaction, and you would be unable to spend your funds anyway, so would be no different from theft. The difference is that a miner (without drivechains) also cannot spend those funds and thus lowers the incentive to do this, but in addition to that, is the next point. * Miners need to provide a proof external to what they are controlling --- that is, miners can be evicted. Proof-of-work mining means that if a coalition of miners exists which is willing to censor, it is possible, theoretically, for honest non-censoring participants to acquire energy and hardware to perform mining. Indeed there is an incentive to do so --- censored transactions will increase their feerates because of lack of confirmation, and thus, there is incentive for a non-censoring miner to increase their hashrate (possibly from 0 --- every fullnode IS a miner, it is just that most fullnodes have 0 hashrate) in order to get paid the fee. Proof-of-stake cannot evict, because once a coalition of stakers exists, they can censor new staking transactions. Thus, honest participants cannot break into a proof-of-stake scheme that has been captured by a majority of censoring stakers. Your proposed scheme seems much more similar to proof-of-stake in this case. Once a much richer adversary is able to get more than 51% voting rights, by spinning up more capacity than you can it is helpful to remember that in the Real World, a lot of people have


                        ### Output: [/INST] In the email, the sender discusses various points related to miners in the Bitcoin network and the contentious nature of drivechains and recursive covenants. The sender explains that existing Bitcoin miners only have the ability to reorder transactions but not to spend funds directly. Drivechains, on the other hand, escrow a set of funds to miners, allowing them to vote and spend those funds as they please. However, this raises concerns as it potentially enables miners to censor transactions.The sender further highlights that miners need to provide proof external to what they are controlling, allowing for the possibility of eviction. Proof-of-work mining incentivizes honest non-censoring participants to acquire energy and hardware to perform mining, as censored transactions will increase their feerates. In contrast, proof-of-stake schemes cannot evict because once a coalition of stakers exists, they can censor new staking transactions. Therefore, honest participants cannot break into a proof-of-stake scheme captured by a majority of censoring stakers.The sender then mentions that the proposed scheme appears similar to proof-of-stake, where a richer adversary could gain more than 51% voting rights by spinning up more capacity. It is important to consider that in the Real World, many people have diverse capabilities.Overall, the email focuses on the role of miners in Bitcoin, the potential implications of drivechains, and the differences between proof-of-work and proof-of-stake mining."

However, in the case of Lightning channel (including Nucleus), no external participant can stick in liquidity: this is a fully permissioned system, which requires 100% of participants to agree on the inclusion of a new participant. Thus, the protection from Sybil attack is much higher and can be based on mechanisms of reputation etc. - that is what I was pointing out in my reply to David Harding. In the case of Bitcoin - yes. In the case of Lightning channels - you always authorise each other participant. Kind regards, me


                        ### Output: [/INST] In the email, the sender addresses a misconception regarding the permissionless nature of the Bitcoin blockchain. They clarify that while the Bitcoin blockchain operates on a permissionless peer-to-peer layer where both miners and users are pseudonymous, the Lightning channel (including Nucleus) is a fully permissioned system. This means that no external participant can join the Lightning channel without the agreement of all participants involved.The sender emphasizes that this permissioned system provides a higher level of protection against Sybil attacks, which are attacks where a malicious actor creates multiple identities to gain control or influence over a network. They mention that mechanisms such as reputation can be used to ensure the inclusion of trustworthy participants in the Lightning channel.It is important to note that in the case of Bitcoin, participants do not need authorization from each other. However, in the case of Lightning channels, participants must authorize each other.Overall, the email clarifies the distinction between the permissionless nature of the Bitcoin blockchain and the permissioned nature of the Lightning channel, highlighting the benefits of the latter in terms of security against Sybil attacks."

                        Context: Greetings, The Sphinx cryptographic packet format as it was originally published in the 2009 paper ( https://www.freehaven.net/anonbib/cache/DBLP:conf/sp/DanezisG09.pdf ) has a very compact packet format but in exchange, performance is sacrificed. Certainly when mixminion was around in 2002 this was the right choice because networks were a lot slower back then. And it may have also been the right choice back in 2009, It's now 2023 and I am highly skeptical of this current choice. The NIKE group operations take orders of magnitude longer to perform than all the other cryptographic primitives in the Sphinx packet combined. Sphinx performs two public key (ecdh group) operations per hop. One is a DH and the other is the ""blinding trick"" (see paper for details). Sphinx is essentially twice as fast if we eliminate the ""blinding trick"" and only have one group operation per hop, the DH. In order to make that work you'd also have to store the group element for each hop within the Sphinx header's routing information section which is properly padded and encrypted for each hop. And also we want to preserve IND-CCA2 so then we can use a NIKE to KEM adapter that combines both public keys with the DH output: ``` func ENCAPSULATE(their_pubkey publickey) ([]byte, []byte) { my_privkey, my_pubkey = GEN_KEYPAIR(RNG) ss = DH(my_privkey, their_pubkey) ss2 = H(ss || their_pubkey || my_pubkey) return my_pubkey, ss2 } func DECAPSULATE(my_privkey, their_pubkey) []byte { s = DH(my_privkey, their_pubkey) shared_key = H(ss || my_pubkey || their_pubkey) return shared_key } ``` With these modifications your Sphinx will be about twice as fast. Or you may choose to combine the KEM with a Post Quantum KEM such as the crypto jedi's Kyber1024 or other PQ KEMs. Let me remind you that Kyber is much faster than even X25519 (and I guess it must also be faster than secp256k1). So combining your NIKE adapted KEM with a PQ KEM like Kyber will probably be the same speed as your current NIKE Sphinx implementation. I made a table of Sphinx benchmarks using the Katzenpost implementation of Sphinx using various NIKEs and KEMs: https://github.com/katzenpost/napkin-mathsphinx-latency The KEM Sphinx using Kyber768 X25519 Hybrid is about the same speed as X25519 NIKE Sphinx. If you are interested in this hybrid PQ construction then you'll want to continue reading below how we do it properly in Katzenpost with a security preserving KEM combiner. However note that the bandwidth overhead is significant when using a Kyber KEM Sphinx because each hop's KEM ciphertext must be stored within the routing info section of the Sphinx header; and those KEM ciphertexts can get pretty big, like 2 kilobytes. And so here we have another table indicating the bandwidth overhead of the Katzenpost Sphinx implementation using various KEMs: https://github.com/katzenpost/napkin-mathbandwidth-overhead There's this KEM Combiners paper, https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/024.pdf which discusses the design of a security preserving KEM combiner. The KEM Combiners paper makes the observation that if a KEM combiner is not security preserving then the resulting hybrid KEM will not have IND-CCA2 security if one of the composing KEMs does not have IND-CCA2 security. Likewise the paper points out that when using a security preserving KEM combiner, if only one of the composing KEMs has IND-CCA2 security then the resulting hybrid KEM will have IND-CCA2 security. Our KEM combiner uses the split PRF design from the paper when combining two KEM shared secrets together we use a hash function to also mix in the values of both KEM ciphertexts. In this pseudo code example we are hashing together the two shared secrets from the two underlying KEMs, ss1 and ss2. Additionally the two ciphertexts from the underlying KEMs, cct1 and cct2, are also hashed together: ``` // H is a hash function func splitPRF(ss1, ss2, cct1, cct2 []byte) []byte { return H(ss1 || ss2 || cct1 || cct2) } ``` Sincerely, David Stainton


                        ### Output: [/INST] In the email, David Stainton raises concerns about the performance of the Sphinx cryptographic packet format. He mentions that while the format is compact, it sacrifices performance. He compares the current choice to the one made in 2002 when mixminion was around and states that he is skeptical about the current choice in 2023. David suggests that by eliminating the ""blinding trick"" and having only one group operation per hop, the performance of Sphinx can be improved. He explains that Sphinx currently performs two public key operations per hop, one being a DH operation and the other being the ""blinding trick"". By storing the group element for each hop within the Sphinx header's routing information section, the performance can be enhanced. He also mentions the need to preserve IND-CCA2 and proposes using a NIKE to KEM adapter that combines both public keys with the DH output.To further improve the performance of Sphinx, David suggests combining the NIKE adapted KEM with a Post Quantum KEM like Kyber1024 or other PQ KEMs. He highlights that Kyber is faster than X25519 and combining the two KEMs would likely result in the same speed as the current NIKE Sphinx implementation. He shares a table of Sphinx benchmarks using the Katzenpost implementation of Sphinx with different NIKEs and KEMs.David also discusses the bandwidth overhead of using a Kyber KEM Sphinx, as each hop's KEM ciphertext needs to be stored within the routing info section of the Sphinx header. He provides another table indicating the bandwidth overhead of the Katzenpost Sphinx implementation with various KEMs.In addition, David mentions a paper on KEM Combiners (https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/024.pdf) that discusses the design of a security preserving KEM combiner. He explains that a security preserving KEM combiner ensures that the resulting hybrid KEM has IND-CCA2 security if at least one of the composing KEMs has IND-CCA2 security. He shares pseudo code for a split PRF function that combines two KEM shared secrets and their ciphertexts using a hash function.Overall, David's email raises concerns about the performance of Sphinx and suggests ways to improve it by eliminating certain operations and combining different KEMs. He also highlights the bandwidth overhead and references a paper on security preserving KEM combiners."
