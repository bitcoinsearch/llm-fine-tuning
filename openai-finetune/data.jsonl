Public key data is indistinguishable from random data, and, unless we are willing to pad the blockchain with proof of knowledge of secret keys, there will be no way to tell a priori whether a given public key is really a public key or whether it is encoding an inscription or some other data. When certain governments try to censor certain internet protocols, users respond by tunnelling their protocol through something that appears to be innocent HTTPS (see Tor bridge nodes). This works because, after a handshake, the remaining HTTPS stream, like public keys, is indistinguishable from random data, and can be used as a communications channel for arbitrary data. If we attempt to ban \"arbitrary data\", those users will simply respond by \"tunneling\" their data over innocent-looking public key data instead. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe Counterparty has, in the past, encoded their data within public key data, so this concern is not hypothetical."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The email discusses the possibility of banning \"arbitrary data\" in programming and its potential consequences.

At least part of the reason for creating this is similar to my reason for creating bips PR1472, and my covenant comparo spreadsheet, i.e. to help further the discussion of these proposals and make more clear the similarities and differences between them. https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1472 https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YL5ttNb6-SHS6-C8-1tHwao1_19zNQ-31YWPAHDZgfo/edit It's become clear to me that in large part the separation between advocates of these two proposals stems from a lack of full understanding of their properties. My hope is that this work helps to clarify our thinking about them individually and together, and potentially move toward consensus on a path toward enabling better lightning, vaults, and likely other amazing ways to use bitcoin in the future. -----------------------  Abstract This proposal is an alternative to [bip119][] and [bip118][], providing the functionality of both proposals with no additional overhead in [many cases](compared-to-non-tapscript-ctv), while clearing certain objections to both, and opening clear upgrade paths. This is, in essence, an initially constrained version of Russel O'Connor's We define three new Tapscript-only opcodes. Replacing `OP_SUCCESS80`, `OP_SUCCESS187`, and `OP_SUCCESS188` with `OP_TXHASH`, `OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK`, and `OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACKVERIFY` respectively.  Summary For `OP_TXHASH`, we define exactly 5 methods of hashing the transaction depending on a minimally encoded numeric argument popped from the stack: argument | behavior -------- | ----------------- 0 | as in [bip119][] 1 | as in [bip118][] with sighash flag `0x41` 2 | as in [bip118][] with sighash flag `0xc1` 3 | as in [bip118][] with sighash flag `0x43` 4 | as in [bip118][] with sighash flag `0xc3` `OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK(VERIFY)` is defined similarly to the [implementation in the Elements project][OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK in elements], but does not internally SHA256 hash the data argument. As [bip340][] defines signatures on arbitrary length messages, and these `OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK(VERIFY)` are defined only in Tapscript, the internal hashing is unnecessarily restrictive. Users may wish to use pre-hashed values as in this proposal, or non-SHA256 hashes available in script.  Motivation Much ink has been spilled on the discussion of what is next for bitcoin scipt development. The two proposals nearest to consensus are [bip118][] and and the merrits of the other. Here, we'll briefly outline some of the objections to each and demonstrate how this proposal reduces those objections. We will not discuss the concerns about the introduction of covenants or recursive covenants generally.  [CTV][bip119] Objections * Not general enough * Inefficient when otherwise validating the hash (e.g. when combined with `OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK`) * Uses `OP_NOPx` extension semantics even though `OP_SUCCESSx` is available  [APO][bip118] Objections * Not general enough * Accidentally enables inefficient, hard to use covenants * Uses new Tapscript key version to avoid accidents  Solutions * By providing the behavior of both [bip118][] and [bip119][], this proposal is more general than either of those proposals. It also provides explicit upgrade hooks for further generality (e.g. to [full OP_TXHASH][OP_TXHASH+OP_CSFS proposal]). * By splitting the hashing from the validation of [bip119], the hash can be used in ways other than `OP_EQUALVERIFY`. * We use `OP_SUCCESSx` upgrade semantics. * We explicitly enable some of the sighash-based covenants accidentally enabled by [bip118][]. * By using new signature checking opcodes, we do not require the safety of a new Tapscript key version.  Specification  `OP_TXHASH` When validating Tapscript, the behavior of `OP_SUCCESS80` is modified as follows: * If there is not at least one item on the stack, fail[^1]. * If the top item on the stack is not a minimally encoded `OP_0`, `OP_1`, or `OP_2`; succeed immediately[^2]. * Pop the top item from the stack, and name it `hash_mode` * If `hash_mode` is 0: * Hash the transaction as defined in [bip119][] * Push the resulting hash to the stack * If `hash_mode` is 1: * Hash the transaction as defined in [bip118][] using `sighash_type=0x41` * Push the resulting hash to the stack * If `hash_mode` is 2: * Hash the transaction as defined in [bip118][] using `sighash_type=0xc1` * Push the resulting hash to the stack * If `hash_mode` is 3: * Hash the transaction as defined in [bip118][] using `sighash_type=0x43` * Push the resulting hash to the stack * If `hash_mode` is 4: * Hash the transaction as defined in [bip118][] using `sighash_type=0xc3` * Push the resulting hash to the stack  `OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK(VERIFY)` When validating Tapscript, the behavior of `OP_SUCCESS187` and `OP_SUCCESS188` are modified as follows: * If there are not at least 3 items on the stack, fail[^1]. * If the top-minus-0 stack item's length is not 32, succeed immediately[^2]. * If the top-minus-2 stack item's length is not 64, fail[^3]. * Pop the top 3 stack items as `pubkey`, `msg`, and `sig` respectively. * Let `result` equal the result of verifying `sig` against `msg` and `pubkey` according to [bip340][]. * Push `true` if `result` otherwise `false` to the stack. * If validating `OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACKVERIFY` * Pop the top item from the stack as `check`. * If `check` is not `true`, fail.  Discussion  How does the efficiency compare to [bip118][]? `SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT`: ``` || OP_CHECKSIG(VERIFY) with pushes: 64+1+1 + 33+1 + 1 = 101 witness bytes (25.25vBytes) ``` This proposal: ``` OP_TXHASH OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK(VERIFY) with pushes: 64+1 + 1 + 1 + 32+1 + 1 = 101 witness bytes (25.25vBytes) ```  How does the efficiency compare to [bip119][]?  Both in Tapscript `OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY` alone: ``` OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY OP_DROP OP_TRUE with pushes: 32+1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 36 witness bytes (9vBytes) ``` `OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY` with a subsequent check: ``` OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY OP_DROP with pushes: 32+1 + 1 + 1 = 35 witness bytes (8.75vBytes) ``` This proposal: ``` OP_TXHASH OP_EQUAL(VERIFY) with pushes: 1 + 1 + 32+1 + 1 = 36 witness bytes (9 vBytes) ```  Compared to non-Tapscript CTV Bare `OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY`: ``` Lock: OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY OP_DROP OP_TRUE with pushes: 32+1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 36 bytes (36vBytes) Unlock: Total: 36 + 0 = 36vBytes ``` Witness v0 CTV: ``` Lock: OP_0 with pushes: 1 + 32+1 = 34 bytes (34 vBytes) Unlock: with sizes: 36+1 = 37 witness bytes (9.25vBytes) Total: 34 + 9.25 = 43.25vBytes ``` This proposal: ``` Lock: OP_1 with pushes: 1 + 32+1 = 34 bytes (34 vBytes) Unlock: with sizes: 36+1 + 33+1 = 71 witness bytes (17.75vBytes) Total: 34 + 17.75 = 51.75vBytes ``` Compared to bare CTV, this proposal is 15.75vBytes more costly. If CTV use cases gain popularity, a separate upgrade for bare CTV may be warranted, either as specified in [bip119][], as its own witness version, or some alternative. Bearing in mind the risks mentioned in [bip119][], fee sensitive users can add `OP_RIPEMD160` to save 2.75 vBytes when using `OP_TXHASH` with `OP_EQUAL(VERIFY)`. This brings the excess cost relative to bare CTV down to 13vBytes.  Why not include modes for [bip118][] sighash_types 0x42 and 0xc2?[^4] Possibly due to a lack of imagination, we are unable to see a use for signing none of the inputs and none of the outputs (or a single input script and none of the outputs).  Can this be used in ln-symmetry? Yes, this is fully compatible with ln-symmetry. It uses a different script, but has the same size and behavior as [bip118][] for this purpose.  Can this be used in PTLCs? Yes, this is fully compatible with PTLCs. It uses a different script, but has the same size and behavior as [bip118][] for this purpose.  Can this be used with OP_VAULT? Yes, this is fully compatible with OP_VAULT. It uses a different script, but has the same size and behavior as [bip119][] for this purpose.

The objections to bip118 include it not being general enough, enabling inefficient and hard-to-use covenants accidentally, and requiring a new Tapscript key version for safety.This proposal aims to provide the behavior of both bip118 and bip119, offer explicit upgrade hooks for further generality, split the hashing from the validation in bip119, enable some sighash-based covenants accidentally enabled by bip118, and use new signature checking opcodes without requiring a new Tapscript key version.The specification of the proposal defines the behavior of OP_TXHASH and OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK(VERIFY) in Tapscript validation. OP_TXHASH hashes the transaction based on a minimally encoded numeric argument popped from the stack, while OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK(VERIFY) verifies a signature against a message and public key according to bip340.The email also discusses how the efficiency of this proposal compares to bip118 and bip119 in terms of witness bytes. It provides examples and calculations for different scenarios and concludes that this proposal may be slightly more costly than bare CTV but offers compatibility with ln-symmetry, PTLCs, and OP_VAULT.The email ends with a discussion on the fields that are hashed in different modes of the proposal and mentions some notes related to validation and signature lengths.Overall, the sender is seeking feedback on this proposal and aims to contribute to the discussion on bitcoin script development, specifically regarding bip118 and bip119."}]}

I presume this was supposed to go to OP_4 now. Just noting BIP118 also allows pubkey of \"1\" to stand in for the taproot inner pubkey, which would be a common use-case. \"simply\" adding an opcode ala OP_INNER_PUBKEY could also have the same effect of course. Also, BIP118 also opens the door for non-APO signatures to have a sighash digest that commits to additional data, closing a couple of taproot malleability bugs. See https://github.com/bitcoin-inquisition/bitcoin/issues/19 for more discussion along those lines. These aren't make or break, but would be nice to clean up if possible Best, Greg"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In this email, Greg provides some additional information related to a topic discussed in a previous conversation with Brandon. He mentions the term \"OP_2\" and suggests that it should be sent to \"OP_4\" instead. Additionally, Greg points out that BIP118 allows for the use of the pubkey \"1\" as a substitute for the taproot inner pubkey. He suggests that simply adding an opcode like \"OP_INNER_PUBKEY\" could achieve the same effect.Greg also highlights that BIP118 addresses taproot malleability bugs by allowing non-APO signatures to have a sighash digest that commits to additional data. He includes a link to a discussion on GitHub for further exploration of this topic.Overall, Greg acknowledges that these details are not crucial but suggests that it would be beneficial to address them if possible."}]}
