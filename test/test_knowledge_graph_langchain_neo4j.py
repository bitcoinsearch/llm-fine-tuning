        "Summary": """The email discusses a downside to using a MuSig API over a single key. The downside is that new people may question the use of the MuSig API and someone knowledgeable will have to explain the historical context and the specific APIs used in libsecp256k1 at that time.

        "Title": "Payment Splitting; Switching and its impact on Balance Discovery Attacks (preprint)",
        "Summary": """Gijs van Dam begins the email by mentioning their previous discussion on Link MPP over alternative routes. They have developed a proof of concept called Payment Splitting &amp; Switching (PSS) by creating a core-lightning plugin. The plugin works by splitting up a payment into multiple parts, with one part following the original route and using the original onion but committing to an HTLC with a lesser amount. Upon receiving this HTLC, the recipient can forward the payment but will wait for another payment from the sender. The sender then sends this additional payment over an alternative route, contingent on the payment hash of the original payment.The interest in Link MPP and PSS arises from Gijs van Dam's research on the Balance Discovery Attack (BDA), also known as the probing attack. PSS allows for route changes and amount changes without the sender's knowledge, which impacts how an attacker interprets information obtained through a BDA. In an LN simulator using real-world data, deploying PSS resulted in up to a 62% drop in information gain compared to earlier work without PSS. Further details on this research can be found in Gijs van Dam's preprint on the Cryptology ePrint Archive.Gijs van Dam welcomes feedback on their research and would like to hear thoughts on the role PSS could play in mitigating probing and/or jamming. They have also written a set of blog posts introducing the research, which can be found at the provided links. Finally, they mention that PSS may also work with PTLC, but this will be discussed at another time.Overall, the email discusses Gijs van Dam's development of the Payment Splitting &amp; Switching (PSS) plugin, its potential applications in mitigating probing and/or jamming, and the impact of PSS on the Balance Discovery Attack (BDA). They provide links to additional resources for further reading and welcome feedback on their research."""

The email encourages participation from both the bitcoin-dev and lightning-dev communities and invites anyone interested to attend and contribute to the discussion. The event is an in-person gathering, and attendees are required to RSVP through the website (https://www.brd23.com/).In summary, the email announces the Bitcoin Research Day, a conference that aims to bring together researchers and developers to discuss the robustness, security, and decentralization of the Bitcoin system.

        "Title": "Sidepools For Improving Payment Reliability At Scale",
        "Summary": """In this email, the sender discusses the difficulty of predicting the future in terms of allocating liquidity on the Lightning Network. They compare allocating liquidity to investing in stocks and highlight the challenges of accurately predicting payment influxes and avoiding over or under-allocation.To address the issue of mis-allocating funds, the sender proposes the concept of sidepools. Sidepools are parallel constructions that allow forwarding node operators to manage the allocation of funds without closing channels. Instead of hosting channels within the sidepool mechanism, actual Lightning Network channels remain on-chain. The sidepool acts as a service for HTLC-swapping to facilitate the allocation of funds in the channels.The sender emphasizes the benefits of retaining 2-participant channels instead of expanding to channels with more participants. This approach reduces the number of participants who know about every payment, thus preserving privacy. Additionally, they mention that sidepools can be implemented using Decker-Wattenhofer decrementing `nSequence` mechanisms without any changes to Bitcoin.The motivation for using sidepools lies in their ability to help maintain liquidity in existing channels. By relying on other participants in the sidepool to receive funds, forwarding node operators can avoid depleting channels. This approach reduces costs compared to opening new channels or performing onchain/offchain swaps. The sender also acknowledges that past performance is not indicative of future performance, highlighting the potential risks of doubling down on specific counterparties.Another advantage of sidepools is their potential to support scaling by mitigating liquidity fluctuations during large buyer movements. The sender suggests the implementation of channel factories for end users and sidepools for forwarding nodes to further enhance scalability.Overall, the sender proposes the use of sidepools as a solution to the challenges of allocating liquidity on the Lightning Network. They provide insights into the benefits of this approach and how it can be implemented while maintaining compatibility with existing Lightning Network design."""
