# LLM Fine-Tuning

Welcome to the LLM Fine-Tuning directory! This repository provides an array of scripts, guides, and resources that are dedicated to helping you fine-tune pre-trained models to suit your particular requirements.

## Libraries Used
The fine-tuning for this project can be executed using one of the following libraries:

- OpenAI
- LLama V2

Both libraries render a comprehensive set of components that are key to the implementation and successful execution of machine learning models.

## Usage
To use this repository, you can clone it to your local machine or download it as a zip file. 
Once you've done that, navigate to the specific directory you need (i.e.,`openai-finetune` or `llamav2-finetune`) and read through the relevant guides provided in them.

Happy Fine-Tuning!
